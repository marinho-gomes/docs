    **Best for**: Creating new scenes, abstract concepts
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Image to Video">
    Animate a static image:

    1. Upload a reference image
    2. Describe the motion you want
    3. Generate the animation

    **Best for**: Bringing photos to life, creating cinemagraphs
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Element Mode">
    Animate specific elements within a scene:

    - Select regions to animate
    - Define motion for each element
    - Keep backgrounds static

    **Best for**: Subtle animations, product showcases

## Prompt Tips for Video

### Describing Motion

Be explicit about movement:

```
# Good
"A bird takes off from a branch, wings spread wide,
flying upward into a blue sky"

# Better
"A red cardinal perched on an oak branch slowly spreads its wings,
then launches upward with powerful wing beats,
ascending diagonally toward the upper right of frame"
```

### Camera Movement

Specify camera behavior:

| Term | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `static camera` | Fixed position |
| `slow pan right` | Horizontal movement |
| `tracking shot` | Follow the subject |
| `zoom in` | Move closer |
| `drone shot` | Aerial perspective |
| `dolly forward` | Move into scene |

### Temporal Terms

Guide the timing:

- "slowly", "gradually", "suddenly"
- "begins to", "continues to", "ends with"
- "loops seamlessly", "transitions to"

## Example Prompts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Nature Scene">
    ```
    Slow aerial drone shot over a misty mountain valley at sunrise,
    clouds rolling through the peaks, golden light illuminating
    the fog, camera slowly descending toward a pristine lake,
    cinematic quality, 4K detail
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Product Animation">
    ```
    A sleek smartphone rotates on a reflective black surface,
    360 degree rotation, studio lighting with subtle reflections,
    product showcase style, smooth continuous motion,
    white background gradient
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Character Animation">
    ```
    Anime character with flowing hair walks forward confidently,
    cape billowing in the wind, determined expression,
    front view tracking shot, vibrant colors,
    studio ghibli style animation
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Abstract Motion">
    ```
    Colorful liquid paint swirls and mixes in slow motion,
    blue and gold colors intertwining, macro photography style,

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Short" icon="clock">
    Begin with 4-second videos to iterate quickly before committing to longer durations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simple Motion First" icon="arrows-alt">
    Master simple camera moves before complex multi-element animations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reference Images" icon="image">
    Use Image-to-Video mode for more control over the visual style
  </Card>
  <Card title="Iterate Prompts" icon="rotate">
    Refine prompts based on results, adding specificity where needed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Warning>
  **Video appears choppy**
  - Try Normal mode instead of Fast
  - Use a higher resolution
  - Simplify the motion in your prompt
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Motion doesn't match prompt**
  - Be more explicit about timing and direction
  - Use temporal terms (slowly, suddenly, etc.)
  - Try a different model
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Generation takes too long**
  - Reduce resolution to 720p
  - Shorten duration to 4 seconds
  - Use Fast mode
</Warning>
